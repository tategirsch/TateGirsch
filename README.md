# Particle Simulator
Project Lead: Tate Girsch
### Overview

The Particle Simulator project visualizes an interactive particle system where particles experience gravity, collisions, and interactions with obstacles in the simulation. The simulator demonstrates fundamental physics principles, such as vector-based motion, and elastic collisions. It allows users to manipulate the environment by adding or removing particles and interacting with obstacles through mouse input.

### Features
* **Collision Handling:** Each particles collisions are individually calculated with the obstacle to ensure precise interactions.
* **Gravity Simulation:** brings the particles to the floor and they bounce
* **Adding Particles:** Pressing "+" adds 50 particles from the simulation
* **Deleting Particles:** Pressing "-" deletes 50 particles from the simulation
* **Obstacle Control:** Dragging the mouse across the screen is linked with the obstacle's position

### How to Run the Program
```bash
javac *.java
